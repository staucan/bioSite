                    <p id="DancingAccomp">Starting at the age of 3, I had a love for Dance! Dancing became a passion of mine and thankfully I was able to have a mother who was
                        able to work hard and get me to the lessions that I needed to take. I am so grateful for her cause without her I would not have been able to have this achievement.

                    <p id="DisneyAccomp">Without having my independent mother show me the rope I would not have had the confidence to venture out and move to another state.
                        I am so proud of myself for following my dreams and moving to a location where I was able to pursue my dancing career, and even after I got hurt and 
                        was unable to continue in that field I was able to switch careers and continue with a company that I loved. Working for the Walt Disney World has opened
                        up so many different avenues for me to be able to pursue.
