                put her through boarding school. She went to boarding school throughout her High School years so that she could have a better education and further her 
                dance career. She started dance ballet at the age of 3, and continued to do so until she was in her young twenties and hurt her ACL. She left South Carolina 
                to pursue a career in dancing with Disney, she started out at a Disney College Program Student and then decided to remain in Florida and have her first 
                business career. She started in food and beverage, then moved into working attractions frontline, then worked her way up to being a coordinator then shortly 
                following being a manager. She decided to leave the Disney Company to further her career with Progressive Insurance and is now a Bodily Injury Claims Adjuster. 
                She has been with this company for almost 2 years because it provides her with an amazing work/life balance. She is currently engaged about to be married in 
                December to her fianc√©, where they will make their family whole with him and her two stepchildren. They are planning on having a winter woodsy fairytale 
                wedding, and Candace plans on being very hand on in the creative process of how the final look will come together. Some of Candaces hobbies include spending 
                time in nature, being outdoors, and sometimes even sitting by a campfire to relax. She often goes camping and loves to travel and see all that the world has 
                to offer. She loves to visit the Florida Springs and go kayaking through the waters and visit Disney Theme Parks. To wine down from a long day at work or with the family
